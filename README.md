# Reinforcement-Learning
Assignments for Deep Mind's Reinforcement Learning Module 2018 at UCL.

This repo is for my assignments in Reinforcement Learning module. It explores the following areas:

## Multi-Armed-Bandits

In notebook I implemented the following algorithms:

* Epsilon Greedy 
* Upper Confidence Bound
* REINFORCE Algorithm

## Gridworld

In the other notebooks, we were tasked with implementing multiple agents on a gridworld.

Basic agents:

* Q Learning
* Double Q Learning
* Sarsa

More advanced agents:

* Online Q-learning
* Experience Replay
* Dyna-Q

Deep Learning agents:

* Neural Sarsa
